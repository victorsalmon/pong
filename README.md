# Pong Game
## ES2015 Concepts, SVG Simplicity
This is an SVG-based pong game that demonstrates ES2015, Babel, webpack, and XML namespace ability. A configuration script allows redesign of the game on the fly to re-use modular code and allow for cool variations of the timeless classic.

## Faithfully Rendered Classic
The original is re-created with attention to detail including some 8-bit sound effects.
